text:Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning ? 	labels: It ’ s a skill . What can I say ? I don ’ t know why , I just have a long routine . 
text: Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops . 	labels: Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine . 
text: True , I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . Tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ? 	labels: Not funny . 	episode_done:True

text: Yeah . And that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational ! 	labels: Right . You can ’ t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs . 
text: In my country , there ’ s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . I think it ’ s about six minutes per hour . 	labels: That ’ s great idea . But don ’ t the Tv station lose a lot of money because of that ? 
text: No . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on Tv in your country ? 	labels: Not as far as I know . We have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! That ’ s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable Tv , where you pay a fixed amount each month . 
text: Some people have satellite and cable Tv in my country , but people don ’ t seem to keen to pay for their Tv programs . Besides , the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programs . 	labels: Well , there ’ s a wildlife documentary on Tv in a few minutes . Shall we ? 	episode_done:True

text: Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ? 	labels: Yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous . 
text: I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves . 	labels: People in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated . 
text: I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you . 	labels: That's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go .

text:In China at least , coffee is often associated with an exotic , well-to-do bourgeois lifestyle . Coffee is often considered a hobby of the well-educated , middle-class people . 	labels: Maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar , surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop . While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace , they are actually showing off ! 
text: Yes . Behind a lifestyle , there is a culture . Young people easily become blind worshippers of a Westernized life . While they may not really like coffee , they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish with money in those high-consumption places . 	labels: Then what about tea ? We need to bear in mind in the first place that tea , rather than coffee , has been the most popular drink for the Chinese people . 
text: Well . Tea represents another facet of popular culture . While a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft , elegant music , a teahouse is often a noisy , crowded , public space . People visit teahouses to associate with others , playing chess , chatting , or simply listening to operas . 	labels: What a pity that the traditional teahouses , as depicted by Lao She , keep fading away so quickly in this metropolis . It is not easy to find an old-fashioned teahouse that suits the ordinary people's spending power either . Teahouses of today all feature a cozy , comfortable environment , and high-quality services , but can easily cost you a good deal — just like a coffee bar . 	episode_done:True

text: That sounds interesting . Have you been involved in any mystery ? 	labels: Not exactly , except that I find horoscope predictions increasingly accurate . I came upon a website which sends me an up-dated message by e-mail each day forecasting my experience in detail . It is amazing to find these forecasts largely in line with my daily life . 
text: What did it say about you then ? 	labels: For example , the message for the day before yesterday notified me that I , as a Leo guy , was to have some " unusual experience in food and drink . And as it turned out , the reality matched this prediction well . Lasi night , I was treated to a dinner party by Mr . Lee . 
text: But it must have been only a coincidence . That's the only way superstition wins over science . 	labels: Oh , no . You can never tell whether such-and-such is science or sheer fraud.If horoscope is really something deceptive , how come quite a size of proportion of young people think highly of it . 	episode_done:True

If no one would like to share it with you , you have to pay it all by yourself .

text:What's your ideal boss ? 	labels: I have had an incredible boss , who was my direct supervisor during the last year of my coop work experience . A-bout two months after I began working for her , she really let me spread my wings . She encouraged me to work independently , because she said she had come to trust my judgment and commitment . So I was able to move forward on projects without having to check in with her every day . Of course , I made certain that she knew what I had accomplished on a daily and weekly basis because I gave her summary reports , although she didn't specifically ask me to . Without her support and encouragement , I don't think I would have felt confident enough to have written up a proposal suggesting that the department change a process that had been in place for a long time . But she was open to suggestions , so long as employees could back them up with research and facts . When I submitted my suggestion , she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work . She then took my revised proposal to her boss . He was a more conservative type , but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks . He did , and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change . I've also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and part-time jobs . And while I'd certainly prefer to work for one like I've just described , I'm the kind of person who can get along with just about anyone . 	episode_done:True

text:What do you think are the main causes of war today ? 	labels: I ’ d say the main reason is poverty . Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . If their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force .

text: Yes . It is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive . 	labels: The problem is that many poor people might suffer . 	episode_done:True

text:Good morning . I ’ d like to ask some questions about your insurance policies . 	labels: Of course . Please sit down . How can I help you ? 
text: I bought a house recently and would like to insure it and its content . 	labels: I see . Here ’ s a pamphlet about our home insurance policy . We ’ Ve named our policy ” umbrella ” . May I ask how much you paid for your home and where you live ? These are the two main thing that decide how much your premiums are . 
text: I understand . I live in the Oakfield area and paid $ 100,000 for my home . 	labels: Let me just check that on my computer . Oakfield is a low risk area , so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month . The other thing to take into account is deductibles . 
text: In this pamphlet it says that the minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000 . what does that mean exactly ? 	labels: It means That the first $ 2000 of any claim you make must be paid by you . The insurance policy covers any amount above that , up to the agreed limit . 
text: Oh , I see . That ’ s fine . What is the advantage of having higher deductibles ? 	labels: If you have higher deductibles , your premium are lower , because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less . 
text: It seems that I should do some calculations before deciding . I presume that the insurance period can be for as long as we agree . 	labels: We initially sign one-year policies with our policyholders . These are renewable after the first year . 
text: If I have a claim , how long does it take to make a settlement ? I ’ Ve heard that with some insurance companies , it can take months . 	labels: That is of great concern to out clients . We aim to satisfy all claims within a month , but we can ’ t guarantee that 	episode_done:True

text:Mr . Brown , I'd like to talk with you about something that is getting to be a problem . I'd like , if possible , to see it settled at this meeting . 	labels: What is it , Mrs . Wang ? 
text: It's about the quality of 300 cartons of dried mushrooms . They reached us two weeks ago , and were immediately examined after they arrived . To our astonishment , about 20 % of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms . We can't accept them in this state . They are unfit for human consumption . And the Medical Officer of Health has issued a Stop Notice on them . 	labels: Is that so ? So far we haven't had any complaint of this kind . Our mushrooms have enjoyed a good reputation for their superior quality for years . We are really at a loss to understand why your lot was found moldy and wormeaten . Have you any evidence ? 
text: Certainly . Here's a survey report by a well-known lab in London , whose testimony is absolutely reliable . 	labels: Though everything may be as you say , there are many factors involved . What's more , your surveyors have not mentioned any cause for the damage . 
text: The mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags , sixty of these bags to a carton . It is stated on the surveyor ? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact . So it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing . 	labels: As you know , before shipment , the Commodity InspectionBureau inspected the goods in question . They concluded that the goods were well dehydrated from fresh and choice material and up to standard for export . 
text: I think the Inspection Bureau at your end , when effecting inspection , only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard . The part that was not dried properly , most probably , escaped their attention . As the amount in question is only 20 % of the whole shipment , I think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss . 	labels: The inspection certificate , which is based on a random selection of 20 % of the consignment as we've agreed on beforehand , is considered final and binding upon both parties . We do not accept any claims for compensation for loss incurred in transit , because you bought the goods F . O . B . Houston and on shipping quality , not on landed quality . Your claim , in our opinion , should be referred to the insurance company , as the mishap occurred after shipment . 
text: We've already got in touch with the underwriter . But they have refused to accept any liability . They attributed the accident to the effects of dampness during the long sea voyage . 	labels: That's a matter over which we could exercise no control , then . I'm afraid I have to insist that you approach the insurance company for settlement , that is , if you have covered this risk in your coverage . 
text: To my regret , we failed to cover contamination . This is an unfortunate oversight on our part and a lesson to us . 	labels: Otherwise the insurance company would no doubt have entertained your case . 	episode_done:True
text:I have been washing the dishes for over a week now . 	labels: Well , I think you are very good at doing the dishes , so maybe you should do them for another week .

text:Excuse me , sir . Are there only 3 programs in your hotel ? 	labels: Of course not . We have 50 channels in all .

text:Isn't it wonderful walking here ? 	labels: What do you mean ? 
text: I mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us . 	labels: Yes , look over there . That's the Empire State Building . My book says it's 102 stories tall . 
text: It's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ? 	labels: You're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering . 
text: What other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ? 	labels: Quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St.Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center . It's a landmark in the history of architecture . 
text: What's there after that ? 	labels: Well then , there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world . 
text: What are they all for ? 	labels: Most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the world . And there are lots of very expensive places . 	episode_done:True

text:Hi ! What are you watching ? 	labels: It ’ s a programme about islam . It ’ s very interesting . 
text: Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ? 	labels: They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage haj . 
text: Why do they go there ? 	labels: Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith . 
text: When muslims pray , they face towards mecca . 	labels: That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed . 
text: I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone . 	labels: That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents . 
text: Pilgrimages are common in many faiths . 	labels: Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages . 
text: Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ? 	labels: I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .

I suggest you take the subway . 
text: The subway ? But is there a subway station next to my hotel ? I have to go between the conference center and the hotel several times a day ... 	labels: No worries , there's a subway station at the conference center itself , and a shuttle from your hotel to the conference center that takes only 5 minutes .

text: Is it expensive to ride on the underground ? 	labels: You can get a daily pass that will allow you to travel unlimited for the whole day for about 6 dollars . Otherwise , you can pay by trip , which is about 50 cents to 2 dollars each trip , depending on how far you go .

You show that you have a message for him and that you have a message for a boy in a red hat. You then give him a message of kindness or whatever was on your heart. You have no idea, sometimes you meet someone who is having a really hard day, and it brings them to tears to have a stranger show them love.	episode_done:True

text: Yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . We can see you are experienced in this particular line . 	labels: Thank you . 
text: But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative . After all , you sold around 400 pieces there last year . You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end . 	labels: That is the result of our hard work . Well , what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then ? 
text: 500 pieces . 	labels: No , no . That's too big a number to be acceptable . Let's put it at 450 pieces . And we'll strive to sell more , of course . We wish to add another clause . For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota , we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts . 
text: All right , let's fix it at 450 pieces then . And for every additional 50 pianos sold , we'll give you 1 % higher commission . 	labels: I suppose all the other terms remain unchanged . 
text: We would like to make a specific mention of one more point . As our sole distributor , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own . 	labels: No , certainly not . That's a reasonable restriction .

text: Can't you hang out with them , too ? 	labels: I could , but all they ever talk about is work , so I always end up feeling left out . 
text: Maybe you should invite her over for dinner , so it's just the two of you . 	labels: I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her ! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her . 
text: It can't be that bad . She was always a really good friend to you . 	labels: You're right . She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge . But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore . 
text: She's probably just excited about her new job . You should give her some time . It would be a shame to lose such a good friend . 	labels: I've given her enough time . I'm over it now .

Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing . 	labels: So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ?

text:Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background . 	labels: I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field . My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used . 
text: What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ? 	labels: Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input . 
text: Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ? 	labels: There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort . 
text: Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome . 	labels: I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done . 
text: What are your strengths and weaknesses ? 	labels: My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more . 
text: Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss . 	labels: I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her one day , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day . 
text: When do you find a job satisfying ? 	labels: My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way . I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner . 
text: How would your coworkers describe you ? 	labels: First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people . Secondly , they'll say I had great customer service skills . I put the customer first . And thirdly , they'll say that I know the law . I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously . 
text: Do you have any questions ? 	labels: Yes , I do . On a scale of one to 10 , what would you say morale was in this company ? 	episode_done:True

You've been sneezing ever since you entered the office this morning . Why don't you take this afternoon off ? If you don't want to see a doctor , at least you can go home and have a good rest . 
text: I can't . I am already behind the schedule . Besides , you know Mr . White . He would think that I was putting him on . 	labels: You didn't do anything but sneeze this morning , and you can't do anything this afternoon like this . Gee ! You've got a fever . 
text: Do I ? Oh , no . 	labels: Listen to me . You go home now . I will call my doctor and have him go over . Ok ?

text:Which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most ? 	labels: I think housing is a big problem . There are thousands of homeless people on the streets . 
text: How would you solve the problem ? 	labels: I have a good idea to solve it . The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes . 
text: It would probably be very expensive . 	labels: I think the government can afford it . Besides , there are many advantages . Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement . 
text: It ’ s not a bad idea . I think education is the biggest problem at the moment . Schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly . 	labels: If we are to invest more money to education , we will need to raise taxes . That wouldn ’ t be popular with voters . 
text: Most voters what everything bout ways . They want the government to pay for lots of things , but without increasing taxes . 	labels: The government should show that it is using money efficiently . Sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project . 	episode_done:True

Anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , I guess . I think I am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over .

text: Alright . We can go check at Sears and see if they have them.And what about Dad ? 	labels: How about the iguana ? 
text: I think it would be a great joke.But I know we'd have to take the iguana back . And the pet store might not let us.So why don't we get him something else ? Some clothes maybe . 	labels: A tie ?

text:Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ? 	labels: Sure . First of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic . 
text: Yeah , that's very important . 	labels: So you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment . 
text: I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer . 	labels: That ’ s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes . 
text: It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it . 	labels: It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications . 
text: But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans . 	labels: I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . 
text: It ’ s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes . 	labels: You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous . 
text: I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time . 	labels: You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement . 
text: It seems that ' clothes make the man ' . 	labels: It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior . 	episode_done:True

Well , I graduated with honors from Chesterton University with a major in Business Administration , with a specialization in Information Management , and I minored in psychology . I chose this course of study for two reasons . I wanted to gain some practical , marketable skills , which the information management track provided , and I also feel that interpersonal skills are essential for professional success , hence the minor in psychology .

text:Does tea-serving follow any special etiquette in China ? Each time I dropped in at my Chinese friends ' homes , their parents would offer me a cup of hot , strong tea , though they never inquired of me about whether I want it . 	labels: You've got a point there . It is a custom and good manners to serve tea to a guest who comes to pay a visit . There is no need to ask if he needs it or not , or if he wants something else . It might be an insult to the guest if he is left sitting there without being served tea . 
text: So the guest is presumed to be thirsty and in need of some drink after the trip . In that case , I guess , in return , the guest doesn't have to drink it if he wouldn't like it . 	labels: It wouldn't be considered rude behavior if he doesn't even take a single drop . But he'd better receive the teacup with both hands and bow his thanks when the cup is brought before his face . When the host pours hot water into his cup , he may also choose to tap his index finger on the table , meaning " Thanks " . No matter if he likes it or not , it is impolite if he doesn't even lay a finger on the cup . 
text: So next time , I'd better take a few sips , to ' save face ' at least , right ? 	labels: Sure . The guest is welcomed by being served tea . But if after chatting for a while , the host asks servants or family members to serve a new cup of tea , or add some hot water , he is giving another signal . 
text: What does that imply , then ? 	labels: More often than not , the understatement is ' I'm afraid it's time you leave ' . 	episode_done:True

text: My purposes are two-fold . On the one hand , I've grown bored of commuting on suffocating buses every day and decided to ride to work . On the other hand , bicycling is a sport , and I intend to build up my body through constantly taking a ride over the weekends . 	labels: Cycling during weekends ? Do you me riding on the mountainous countryside just the neighboring towns ? 
text: Does that make any difference ? 	labels: Can't be greater . If you ride on bumpy , hilly roads , a mountain bike is what you need . But if you just ride comfortably along the city lanes , you might choose a road bike . 
text: Are they designed differently ? 	labels: A road bike features skinny tires and a light-weight frame . Its riding position puts you bent over the handlebars . It's not particularly beefy in construction , and generally , it won't stand up well under heavy loads or on really rough surfaces . In contrast , mountain bikes have wide tires and a stout frame .

text:Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background . 	labels: I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field . My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used . 
text: What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ? 	labels: Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input . 
text: Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ? 	labels: There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort . 
text: Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome . 	labels: I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done . 
text: What are your strengths and weaknesses ? 	labels: My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more . 
text: Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss . 	labels: I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her one day , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day . 
text: When do you find a job satisfying ? 	labels: My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way . I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner . 
text: How would your coworkers describe you ? 	labels: First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people . Secondly , they'll say I had great customer service skills . I put the customer first . And thirdly , they'll say that I know the law . I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously .

text: Such as ? 	labels: They offer clearer and sharper images . Many of them also have up to 20x optical zoom lenses , a photo mode and fast-action mode . 
text: They are very compact and are designed to be used with one hand . 	labels: Right ! Anyway , the basic difference between a digital camcorder and its traditional counterpart is that it speaks digital . 
text: What does this mean ? 	labels: This means digital camcorders can be connected with the digital equipments you have at home , like your digital TV or your computer . 
text: I can transfer my home video clips from my camcorder to my computer for editing . 	labels: Sure ! And without any conversion process or loss of quality ! You quickly find , cut , and record video segments and create slide shows . Some camcorders even offer editing software for adding titles and special effects . 
text: What special effects ? 	labels: Like creating a sepia tone look and some special effects such as fades and dissolves .

text:Hi , Bob , everything okay ? 	labels: More or less . There's just one thing bothering me . 
text: Oh ? What's that ? 	labels: Well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy . 
text: What gift ? 	labels: It's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . I don't think I've done anything to deserve that gift , so I refused it . 
text: You refused the gift ? That's terrible . 	labels: I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way . 
text: Perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade . 	labels: That's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . I think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page . 	episode_done:True

text:Excuse me . Can you tell me how to find some books on social science ? 	labels: Sure . You see all these little drawers here and all the way around the walls ? 
text: Yes . 	labels: These drawers contain cards describing every book in our library . Together they constitute the library's " card catalog " . You can see that each drawer runs from one part of the alphabet to another . Fox example , this drawer goes from SCA to SCM . 
text: So if I'm looking for a look called A History of Western Society , I'd just look under ' A ' . 	labels: No . You'd look under ' W ' . The articles ' a ' and ' the ' don't count in our alphabetization , and cards are generally omitted for extremely common words and phrases such as ' history of ' , ' introduction to ' , ' story of ' and so forth . 
text: What if I don't know the title of the book ? 	labels: Well , you can look under the author's name .

text:In 1986 , a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment . This sport is very challenging . It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance . Especially when descending , as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back , they sway around . The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it . Even if they jump off , they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes . No wonder people give the title ' brave ' to anyone who jumps off . 	labels: You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth . The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord . 
text: Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage . 	labels: A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , " When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous . When I looked down , I was nervous even more . If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to ' bakemeat ' . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was 30 seconds . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or eight seconds . When rebounding to the high altitude , I felt a sudden sense of relief . I did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable . " 	episode_done:True

text:Do you think chinese families have changed much in the last 50 years ? 	labels: I think families everywhere have changed a lot in the last 5 decades . 
text: What do you think is the biggest change ? 	labels: Well , in the past , three or four generations would live together under the same roof . Nowadays , living in the same city as one's relatives is becoming rare . 
text: That's true . You know , some husbands and wives don't even live in the same city any more . 	labels: Would you consider having your parents live with you when they get older ? 
text: I guess I'm a bit old-fashioned . I'd rather have my parents live with me than live in a retirement room . 	labels: That's very respectable , but I could never live with my parents . I usually only see them at our christmas celebration — and that's enough ! 
text: How about your other siblings ? Do they spend a lot of time with your parents ? 	labels: Two of my sisters still live at home , even though they have already graduated from university and have good jobs . They enjoy spending their free time with my parents . I guess in that respect , I'm the black sheep of the family . 
text: I see . Do your parents ever ask you to come home to visit them more often ? 	labels: They're always asking me to come home , but I think our relationship is better if we keep a distance from each other . Whenever we see each other , all we do is fight . 	episode_done:True

text: Oh , right ! Do you have many exams at the end of each semester ? 	labels: That depends . Some semesters have many , some don't . And some courses don't have exams but only ask for papers . That's easy . 
text: And when do you prepare for your final exam ? 	labels: Honestly speaking , most students prepare it one month before the exam . 
text: Really ? You only review your lessons in one month ? Does it work ? 	labels: Of course , it's useful . And it's very crucial to have the copies of teacher's notes , because most questions in the exam are based on them . 
text: Wow , and all the key points are included in them ? You're so smart ! 	labels: But the exam is not as simple as you may imagine . We have to stay up late .

text: I ’ Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring . I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day . Of course I won ’ t miss the local food either . You know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place . 	labels: I agree . As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects . That is frightening . 
text: Sure it is . Is it convenient to get there by plane ? 	labels: Well , the airport is quite far from the downtown area , but it is still more convenient than taking the train . 	episode_done:True

text:It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed ... The trade deficit is getting larger , consumption's down , I really think we're headed for a recession . 	labels: The economy has been stagnant for a while now . We've been in a recessive state for several months already . What worries me the most is the trade deficit . I think the government should do more to encourage exports . 
text: Increasing exports would weaken the currency . I think the main point is economic growth . We need more jobs . Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . If more people are working , it will give the economy a boost . 	labels: It's true that we should do something about unemployment , but what about inflation ? If unemployment falls , there's pressure to increase pay . That would result in inflation , which would result in a much less dynamic economy . 	episode_done:True

text: I know. They will try to take advantage of people.	labels: Yes, you should take somebody that knows about cars.
text: Yeah, I'm going to take Joseph. He knows everything about cars.	labels: Good idea. How much are you planning to spend?
text: I have $20,000.	labels: Wow. Are you going to pay for the car? Or will you be making payments?

text: They wear the same clothes , they ’ re all blond , they all drive cars , they all own Parker fountain pens ; they all drink Coca Cola , and they all chew gum . 	labels: I disagree with you . They don ’ t all wear the same clothes ; they ’ re definitely not all blond ; they don ’ t all own Parker fountain pens ; they don ’ t all drink Coca Cola , and they don ’ t all chew gum . I do think they all drive cars though ! But that doesn ’ t have anything to do with how they look ! 	episode_done:True
text:Welcome to Al ’ s Garage . What seems to be the problem ? 	labels: No problem at all ! I am taking a long road trip and I want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition . 
text: Very wise decision . When was the last time you had a tune up ? 	labels: Not that long ago , I think it was four months ago . 
text: We usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers . 	labels: Why ? I mean , what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ? 
text: First of all , we change the motor oil and oil filter . If you don ’ t do this , it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves . 	labels: I see . What else ? 
text: We also check your spark plugs , fuel filter , and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones . 	labels: Ok , well , when you put it that way , it doesn ’ t seem like a waste of time and money . 	episode_done:True
text:Look what you've done ! 	labels: I'm very sorry , sir . I'll bring you a cloth immediately .

text: Sounds interesting ! That must be very convenient . 	labels: Yes , you're right . I can blog wherever and whenever I'm on the move . It's especially good when I'm on a business trip and my laptop happens to be away from me .

text:Are you introverted or extroverted ? 	labels: I wouldn't call myself introverted . Sometimes I enjoy being by myself very much . But other times I like sharing activities with others too . 
text: What kind of personality do you think you have ? 	labels: Well , I approach things very enthusiastically , I think , and I don ’ t like to leave something half-done . It makes me nervous . I can ’ t concentrate on something else until the first thing is finished . 
text: What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ? 	labels: For me , this would be having good relationships with my family members . My family has always been very close knit , and we still spend a lot of time together . 
text: What basic principles do you apply to your life ? 	labels: Working hard and being frugal are both virtues . I strive to practise these two virtues in my life . 	episode_done:True

text: You had been walking for 6 hours , isn ’ t that boring ? 	labels: Of course not ! We built a snowman , some snow dogs and one big snow fort . We went sliding on the nice hill . It was a real work out . At noon , we had the most special winter picnic outside . Fortunately , we got it all on a video tape . You must come with us next time .

text: Frankly speaking , the price you offer is too high . We can't accept it . 	labels: Why ? This is a fair market price . 
text: It certainly is . 	labels: Then what leads you to think that we have to reduce our price ? Please tell me candidly . 
text: I look at it this way , suppliers should be able to reduce their CIF price , even lower than their home price . 	labels: We give you quotations on the same basis as we quote in the domestic market . 
text: That's the point . Your overhead is in your domestic price , but it can't be carried in the CIF price . 	labels: But even with the overhead out , the export overhead must be put in . Finally , it comes to the same thing . Anyway , this is a quality item and should be sold on its value . 	episode_done:True

You know , I ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg . 	labels: I don ’ t know about that ; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ’ s just too much instability . I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate . 
text: But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity . And anyway , I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example , they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity . 	labels: Come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point . 	episode_done:True

text:Welcome to our show ! Today , I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich ! Are you ready ? Let ’ s get started ! 	labels: Let ’ s start with the basics , bread . Bread is an important ingredient here . You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria , freshness , crumb and color . If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven , or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color . 
text: Now that our bread is ready , let ’ s talk about the ingredients ! Of course , each person ’ s palate is different , but I ’ m going to give you a few tips that you ’ ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich . I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich . 	labels: Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light . The best choices here are evident — cucumbers , tomatoes , onions , sweet pepper or chilli , lettuce and , of course , herbs — you can ’ t go wrong with them . As for aubergines , mushrooms and asparagus , I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil . 
text: Last but not least , we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich . We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper , or we can combine mustard sauce , mayonnaise , ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor ! It ’ s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt ! 	labels: That ’ s all the time we have for today , but join us next time where we ’ ll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna ! Till next time ! 	episode_done:True
